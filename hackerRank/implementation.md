#### grading students

- create a const to filter the grades that maps over the grades
- return: check if grade is bigger or equal 38 and if the rest of grades is bigger or equal 3
- if it is: then subtract from grade: the rest o grade % 5 plus 5
  // example: 73 - (2) + 5 = 75
- if it is not, return grade
- return filteredGrades

#### number line jumps

- declare variable kang 1 and kang 2 equal to their position
- for loop
- assignment with position and speed
- if the position of both is true, return true, otherwise return no

// OR (solution from internet)

- create result "NO"
- if jump from the first kangaroo is smaller or equal than v2, return result
- while position from first kangaroo is smaller or equal than x2, use the assignment to increase the jump to position
- if position is equal, set result to yes and break
- return result after while

#### between two sets
